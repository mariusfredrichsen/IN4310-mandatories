class ResNet(nn.Module):
    '''
    Some basic definitions: 

    - Layer: The basic building unit in neural networks, such as convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, and ReLU activation layers.

    - Block: A group of layers that together form a residual block in ResNet. 
            Each block typically consists of a few convolutional layers and a shortcut (residual) connection.

    - Stage: A sequence of blocks that operate at the same spatial resolution in the network. 
            For example, in ResNet, the network downsamples (reduces spatial dimensions) at the beginning of a new stage.
